# This script is intended as an example of how to scan objects for viruses.
# In this example, the LocalCacheFilter and ShellCommandFilter are used to copy objects to a local directory to be
# scanned before being sent to the target storage.  If the scan fails, the objects are considered infected and not
# copied to the target (this script can optionally copy them to a quarantine area)

# set this to the direction location configured in the LocalCacheFilter (localCacheRoot)
LOCAL_CACHE_ROOT=/tmp/sync-cache

# set to the quarantine root directory location
# blank this value to disable quarantine (the cache files will be deleted)
QUARANTINE_ROOT=/tmp/quarantine

# set to the user.group that will own quarantined files
