Standard Install Layout
=========

/opt/emc/ecs-sync       this directory should be created and owned by the ecssync user. contains all .jar files with
                        symbolic links to specific versions (i.e. ecs-sync.jar -> ecs-sync-2.1.jar). also contains the
                        application-production.yml config file

/var/log/ecs-sync       log directory. this should be created and owned by the ecssync user.

/etc/init.d             service script location. place scripts from init.d/ (in distribution zip) here

/etc/logrotate.d        log rotate scripts. place scripts from logrotate.d/ (in distribution zip) here

install.sh              convenience installation script; basically does all of the above

/etc/httpd              apache config dir. place files from httpd/ (in distribution zip) here to access the UI

configure-centos.sh     configuration script for CentOS; installs most deps and configures apache, mysql, etc.
                        and also takes care of the extra configuration steps below

=========

NOTE: if you find the services are only listening on ipv6 localhost (:::1), you need to disable ipv6 in the OS.
in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

Also, if you're having trouble with apache and ProxyPass (disabled connection from localhost), you need to allow httpd
to connect to the network:

setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1

Also a good idea to reduce "swappiness" of virtual memory since these processes use lots of RAM. 10 is recommended

in /etc/sysctl.conf:

vm.swappiness = 10

then:

sysctl -p
