NOTE: for full UTF-8 support, mysqld configuration must be modified. The following additions are required:

in /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf (or just /ect/my.cnf):

[server]
innodb_file_format=Barracuda
innodb_large_prefix=1
innodb_file_per_table=1

mysqld must be restarted after this change and the scripts under the utf8 dir in the distribution package must be used
to create the database.
